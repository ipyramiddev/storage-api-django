Django storages
===============

Installation
============

You need to patch your Django source code with the latest patch of this 
ticket::

    http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5361

After that you just need to populate your settings with a reference to your
new storage::

    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'yourapp.storages.S3Storage'

Eventually you can use the new storage::

    from django.core.filestorage import storage

Enjoy!
